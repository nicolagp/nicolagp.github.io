## About
My name is Nicolas but most call me Nico, here are some facts about me:

- I'm on my last year of the combined Bachelor's + Master's program at USC, studying Mathematics and Electrical Engineering, respectively.
- I like Math.
- I don't know much about Electrical Engineering, but I only take the Math and ML classes, so that is ok.
- I love endurance sports -- I have done several triathlons and I'm part of the USC Triathlon team.
